<p>We realize energy-efficient computing systems in the hardware and algorithm co-design fashion. Our vision of end-to-end hardware-software convergence includes research projects that: (1) simulate, fabricate, and characterize novel electronic devices that natively possess functions directly applicable to AI applications in their dynamics, (2) develop device physics-enabled algorithms, circuits/architectures supporting algorithms for brain-inpsired neuromorphic systems and AI accelerators, and (3) invent cognitive algorithms enabling more efficient and better AI model inference.</p>

<h2>Ultra-wide-band-gap semiconductors for power electronics</h2>

<p>Ultra-wide-band-gap (UWBG) semiconductors have tremendous potential for RF and high-power electronics as the wider band gap allows for higher breakdown voltage that enables high-power and fast switching with lower energy loss. However, a wider band gap generally leads to doping inefficiency and carrier localization, which inhibits semiconductor applications. The focus of our research is to discover new UWBG semiconductors that are unexplored but have superior material properties to surpass the state of the art. To do this, we use first principles defect calculation based on hybrid density functional theory to uncover novel UWBG semiconductors with efficient doping properties. We then experimentally realize prospective materials by growing single-crystalline thin films using epitaxial growth techniques and characterizing the structural and electronic properties of films. We also explore various dopants and the interplay between charged defects to enhance doping efficiency while pushing to the limit to semiconductor band gap.</p>

<h2>Entropy-stabilized oxide memristors for neuromorphic computers</h2>
<p>A memristor is an emerging device that can drastically advance computing performance. It co-locates compute-and-memory capability and adopts a new computing paradigm as an alternative to conventional von-Neumann architecture-based computers. Despite this powerful strength, its applicability has been severely restricted by the stochasticity and limited tunability of amorphous switching mediums. As an alternative, we study memristors based on entropy-stabilized oxides (ESO). ESOs are single phase composed of more than 5 different cations, thus, memristors based on single crystalline ESOs show robust switching dynamics that can be precisely controlled by the composition of constituent cations. We design optimal composition of ESO for target switching properties, fabricate and measure single-crystalline memristors, and collaborate with software engineers to implement networks with the devices. </p>

<h2>Back-end-of-line compatible semiconductors for heterogeneous integration</h2>
<p>Back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible complementary transistors can boost chip performance beyond Mooreâ€™s law by breaking through the scaling barrier of conventional CMOS design and providing a new integration approach, i.e., monolithic 3D integration. Such 3D integration can also stack logic and memory together to boost data-intensive computing such as in-memory computing. This technology is enabled by low-temperature synthesis of channel semiconductors under the constraint of limited thermal budget (<400 C). Our objective is to develop novel oxide semiconductors with low process temperature, wide-band-gap, and high mobility. Our particular focus is developing high-mobility p-type oxides which has been the primary challenge of this power-saving technology. We use orbital hybridization approach to develop novel p-type oxides and use various film integration techniques to fabricate back-end-of-line compatible devices.</p>
