<p>We realize energy-efficient computing systems in the hardware and algorithm co-design fashion. Our vision of end-to-end hardware-software convergence includes research projects that: (1) simulate, fabricate, and characterize novel electronic devices that natively possess functions directly applicable to AI applications in their dynamics, (2) develop device physics-enabled algorithms, circuits/architectures supporting algorithms for brain-inpsired neuromorphic systems and AI accelerators, and (3) invent cognitive algorithms enabling more efficient and better AI model inference.</p>
<p>The targeted application of my research is microelectronics for high performance computing, high-density memory and storage, and energy-efficient power control and conversion. In microelectronic technology, the performance of devices is ultimately determined by the physical properties of the component materials. To keep up with the todayâ€™s needs for artificial intelligence, big data, and autonomous vehicles, there is an urgent need for developing advanced semiconductor, dielectric, magnetic, and memory materials that are energy efficient at high power and high frequency. We focus on oxide materials which exhibit a variety of exotic functional properties not observed in traditional Si-based semiconductor materials.</p>

<h2>Entropy-stabilized oxide memristors for neuromorphic computers</h2>
<p>A memristor is an emerging device that can drastically advance computing performance. It co-locates compute-and-memory capability and adopts a new computing paradigm as an alternative to conventional von-Neumann architecture-based computers. Despite this powerful strength, its applicability has been severely restricted by the stochasticity and limited tunability of amorphous switching mediums. As an alternative, we study memristors based on entropy-stabilized oxides (ESO). ESOs are single phase composed of more than 5 different cations, thus, memristors based on single crystalline ESOs show robust switching dynamics that can be precisely controlled by the composition of constituent cations. We design optimal composition of ESO for target switching properties, fabricate and measure single-crystalline memristors, and collaborate with software engineers to implement networks with the devices. </p>
