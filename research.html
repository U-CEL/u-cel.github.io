<p>We realize energy-efficient computing systems in the <span style="font-style: italic;color: #DC4405">hardware and algorithm co-design</span> fashion. Our vision of <span style="font-style: italic;color: #DC4405">end-to-end</span> hardware-software convergence includes research projects that: (1) simulate, fabricate, and characterize novel electronic devices that natively possess functions directly applicable to AI applications in their dynamics, (2) develop device physics-enabled algorithms for brain-inspired neuromorphic computing systems and AI accelerators, and (3) Integrate the devices and algorithms with customized circuits and architecture in a chip.</p>
<p> Maximizing each counterpart's capability, the co-design manner will meet an urgent demand for energy-efficiency deteriorated by ever-growing data size and algorithmic complexity for better AI while achieving high performance. Smartly leveraging device dynamics will eliminate unnecessary costs arising from digital-processing of analog and non-linear functions that are natural to human but expensive to digital computers. Inspiration from the brain grants abilities to learn and perform intelligent tasks better and more efficiently in a biological manner to build intelligent systems, without massive astronomical training and inference costs. All the elements can collaboratively accomplish the dream of true “Artificial Intelligence” that thinks, learns, and operates as the name means, beyond the current stage of “machine intelligence”.</p>

<h2>Physics-based Neural Network (PNN) as a new type of deep learning</h2>
<p>Neural networks (NNs) have been developed inspired by the biological computing core, the brain. The inspiration makes NNs employ <span style="font-style: italic;color: #DC4405">non-linear</span> behavior of biological neurons and synapses which provide higher-order information processing capability to the brain. For the reason, today's NNs leverage mathematical non-linear function in every hierarchy which is expensive in energy and time. Physics-based Neural Networks (PNNs) have been investigated to ease the computational burden that is inevitable for conventional non-linear functions.  </p>

<h2>Compute-in-Memory (CiM) with emerging memories</h2>
<p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown outstanding capabilities on various tasks, which has made human life much easier. However, the demand for the better has made DNNs more complicated and power-consuming. As a two big component of </p>
